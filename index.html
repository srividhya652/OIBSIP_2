<h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, which was then part of the British Empire.
Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in Porbandar, persuaded him to study law.
After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried to start his career as a lawyer.
</p>
<h3>Return to India</h3>
<p>
In 1914, Gandhi sailed from South Africa to India, where he founded an ashram that was open to all castes.


</p>


</p>
<h3>India’s Independence</h3>
<p>
After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable.
The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian National Congress clamoured for more.
But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed.
In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and Pakistan. 
</p>

<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>
Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his belief in simple living — making his clothes, eating a vegetarian diet — has been a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world for decades to come after his death.
Gandhi's actions inspired future human rights movements around the globe, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States and Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
